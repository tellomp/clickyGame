# Grey's Anatomy Clicky Game

### Overview
 * Try to remember which Grey's Anatomy character you click on and don't click on then again to score points!

### Requirements and Instructions

* Created a React application using Create React App and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* The app renders 12 different Grey's Anatomy characters to the screen and each image listens for click events.

* Everytime the user clicks on a character that has not been previously clicked on, the app increments the user's score. 

* The app keeps track of the user's score. 

* The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
